\usage{
KRCI(res, Q, B, kcoe, costcoe, level, qw, tpw)
}
\arguments{
\item{res}{an object of class gmnl}

\item{Q}{number of random draws from standard distributions (normal or uniform)}

\item{B}{number of bootstrap samples}

\item{kcoe}{vector of positions (in the res$coe vector) of the parameters for which wtp is to be computed}

\item{costcoe}{position (in the res$coe vector) of the cost parameter}

\item{level}{vector of confidence level to compute confidence and prediction intervals (i.e. 0.9, 0.95â€¦)}

\item{qw}{value (the same for all parameter for which wtp is to be computed) at which upper tail probability
for wtp distribution is to be computed}

\item{tpw}{probability (the same for all parameters for which wtp is to be computed) at which quantiles leaving
that probability in the upper tail of wtp distribution are to be computed}
